# Risk Engine
This project aims to simulate a basic functioning risk engine to aid in learning about pricing and risk analysis of financial instruments, by studying existing open source implementations such as [Open Source Risk Engine](https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine) and [QuantLib](https://www.quantlib.org/reference/index.html). 

# Getting Started
Ensure that you have the minimum required version of CMake installed. You also need a working C++ compiler and have Make installed as well. You can either generate the makefile using the Cmake GUI, or create a `/build` folder, navigate to it and run `cmake` from the command line. Once the makefile has been generated, simply run `make` to generate the binary. The entry point that is created for the application is `./main`.
